# Ulrack JSON Schema

This package contains a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) validator 
library for PHP. It support Draft 07 and 06.

To get a grip on JSON schema's, what they are and how they work, please see the
manual of [json-schema-org](https://json-schema.org/learn/).

The package generates a reusable validation object, which can be used to verify
data against.

## Installation

To install the package run the following command:

```
composer require ulrack/json-schema
```

## Usage

Before a validation object can be created, the factory for the validators needs
to be instantiated. This can be done by using the following snippet:
```php
<?php

use Ulrack\JsonSchema\Factory\SchemaValidatorFactory;

$factory = new SchemaValidatorFactory();
```

All of the below described method of generating a validation object will result
in a [ValidatorInterface](https://github.com/ulrack/validator/blob/master/src/Common/ValidatorInterface.php).
To verify data against this object, simply pass the data to the `__invoke` 
method, like so:
```php
<?php

use Ulrack\Validator\Common\ValidatorInterface;

/** @var ValidatorInterface $validator */
$validator($myData); // returns true or false.
```

After the factory is created there are 4 options to create the validation object.

### Object injection

If an object is already created by a (for example) a previous call to 
`json_decode` (second parameter must be either null or false, to get an object).

The validation object can be created by calling the `create` method on the 
previously instantiated `SchemaValidatorFactory`.

```php
<?php

use Ulrack\JsonSchema\Factory\SchemaValidatorFactory;

/** @var object|bool $schema */
/** @var SchemaValidatorFactory $factory */
$factory->create($schema);
```

It is also possible to create a verified validation object.
This is possible when the `$schema` property is set on the 
provided schema. The schema will then be validated against
the schema which is defined on the property. This can be 
done with the following snippet:

```php
<?php

use Ulrack\JsonSchema\Factory\SchemaValidatorFactory;

/** @var object|bool $schema */
/** @var SchemaValidatorFactory $factory */
$factory->createVerifiedValidator($schema);
```

### Local file

To create a validator object from a local schema file, it is also possible to
reference this file location to a method and let this method load it. This
can be done with the following snippet:
```php
<?php

use Ulrack\JsonSchema\Factory\SchemaValidatorFactory;

/** @var SchemaValidatorFactory $factory */
$factory->createFromLocalFile('path/to/my/schema.json');
```

### Remote file

A schema can also be loaded from a remote location, for example: 
[http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#](http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#).
To load a schema from a remote location, use the following method:
```php
<?php

use Ulrack\JsonSchema\Factory\SchemaValidatorFactory;

/** @var SchemaValidatorFactory $factory */
$factory->createFromRemoteFile('http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#');
```

### From string

If a validation object needs to be created from a JSON string, use the method
`createFromString`.

```php
<?php

use Ulrack\JsonSchema\Factory\SchemaValidatorFactory;

/** @var SchemaValidatorFactory $factory */
$factory->createFromString(
    '{"$ref": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}'
);
```
